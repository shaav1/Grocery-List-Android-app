# Test Plan

*This is the template for your test plan. The parts in italics are concise explanations of what should go in the corresponding sections and should not appear in the final document.*

**Author**: Team 2

## 1 Testing Strategy

### 1.1 Overall strategy

Unit - We will first check if we can instantiate the User class since it is the first part of the app necessary to test everything else. Then create all the other classes to test them out with the User class.

Integration - We will do bigbang testing to see all the nooks and crannies of the classes when tested all together. We only have 4 classes, so it’s better to do it all together

System - We will provide an end to end testing by checking how the components of the product interact with each other and the system as a whole.We would have to check the user experience and verify thorough testing of every input in the application.

Regression Testing - We will be running functional and non-functional tests repeatedly to ensure that previously developed and tested software performs whenever there is a change. When performance isn’t as expected, then a regression test will be done.

### 1.2 Test Selection (*needs updating)

Depending on the requirements we will determine test cases but first we will have to make sure that our product can fully create a user’s list.


### 1.3 Adequacy Criterion

We will assess the quality of our test cases by determining the different functions that the user will most likely and oftenly use. We will test edge cases to make sure that the product will work for even cases and scenarios in which a user will not likely create.

### 1.4 Bug Tracking

We will provide a bug button in the product where the user will be able to report any sort of bug he/she may run into when using the application. This report will then be forwarded to the development team and project manager which will then be discussed for future improvements.

### 1.5 Technology

We will use JUnit frameworks and Selenium to test our product. 

## 2 Test Cases (*needs updating)

*This section should be the core of this document. You should provide a table of test cases, one per row. For each test case, the table should provide its purpose, the steps necessary to perform the test, the expected result, the actual result (to be filled later), pass/fail information (to be filled later), and any additional information you think is relevant.*
